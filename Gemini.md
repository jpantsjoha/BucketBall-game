# BucketBall 2028 - CEO Strategic Directive

## Mission
Create the world's most addictive physics-based casual game - a digital reinvention of the classic bucket toss that players instinctively reach for during micro-moments of downtime.

## Core Product Vision

### The Game Loop That Matters
- **30-second sessions** - Quick enough for an elevator ride, deep enough for mastery
- **Instant gratification** - Zero tutorial needed, immediate fun
- **Skill progression** - Easy to play, impossible to perfect
- **Viral mechanics** - Trick shots that players want to share

### Business Objectives
1. **Engagement First** - Build habits through perfect game feel
2. **Viral Growth** - Design for social sharing and competition
3. **Monetization Ready** - Foundation for tournaments, cosmetics, and premium features
4. **Platform Agnostic** - Mobile-first but works everywhere

## Non-Negotiable Quality Standards

### Performance
- **60 FPS always** - Drops are unacceptable
- **<100ms input latency** - Must feel instantaneous
- **<2 second load time** - Instant play is core to retention

### User Experience
- **Two-tap simplicity** - Arm, then throw (prevents accidents)
- **Physics must feel real** - Wind, bounce, and gravity create believable moments
- **Every action has feedback** - Visual, audio, or haptic response required
- **Trick shots feel earned** - Double points for skilled lawn bounces

## Development Philosophy

### What We Build
✅ Features that increase session frequency  
✅ Mechanics that reward practice  
✅ Polish that delights players  
✅ Systems that scale globally  

### What We Don't Build
❌ Complex tutorials that slow onboarding  
❌ Features that complicate the core loop  
❌ Graphics that compromise performance  
❌ Mechanics that feel unfair or random  

## Success Metrics

**Technical Excellence**
- 95%+ frames at 60 FPS
- <0.1% crash rate
- <100ms input response time

**Player Engagement**  
- 40%+ daily return rate
- 3-5 minute average session
- 20%+ trick shot completion rate

**Business Impact**
- 25%+ Day 7 retention
- 5%+ social share rate
- <$0.50 user acquisition cost

## The North Star

Every decision filters through one question:  
**"Does this make players want to take just one more shot?"**

If it doesn't increase fun, engagement, or performance - it doesn't ship.

## Quality Assurance & Product Compliance Framework

### QA Testing Specialist Integration
All development must pass through our **QA Testing Specialist** (see `qa-testing-specialist.md`):

**ZERO TOLERANCE Quality Gates:**
- ✅ **60 FPS performance** - No frame drops acceptable
- ✅ **<100ms input latency** - Instantaneous feel mandatory  
- ✅ **Cross-device compatibility** - Identical experience everywhere
- ✅ **Visual regression prevention** - No UI/UX degradation
- ✅ **E2E functionality validation** - Core user journeys working

**QA Enforcement:**
- Selenium/Playwright MCP tools for automated UI validation
- Real browser testing for all changes
- Performance profiling before release
- Cross-platform verification (desktop, mobile, tablet)

### Product Owner Compliance Agent (POCA)
All features must achieve **POCA approval** (see `product-owner-compliance.md`):

**Strategic Alignment Rubric (Mandatory 4+/5):**
- **R1 - Strategic Clarity**: Direct contribution to $1M+ market opportunity
- **R7 - Production Readiness**: Safe for global deployment

**BRUTAL HONESTY ENFORCEMENT:**
After previous failures claiming "95% ready" when reality was 37/100, POCA enforces:
- ❌ **ZERO INFLATION** of readiness assessments
- ❌ **IMMEDIATE REJECTION** for strategic misalignment  
- ✅ **EVIDENCE-BASED** approval only

### Agent Integration Workflow
1. **Development** → Feature implementation
2. **QA Specialist** → Comprehensive testing & validation
3. **POCA Review** → Strategic alignment & production readiness
4. **CEO Approval** → Final business impact assessment
5. **Deploy** → Only after all gates pass

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. Every release must earn its way to production.**

*Remember: We're not making a game about throwing balls into buckets. We're crafting moments of pure satisfaction that transcend the simplicity of the mechanics.*
