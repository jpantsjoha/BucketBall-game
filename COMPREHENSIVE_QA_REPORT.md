#### ✅ **Physics "Feel Real"**
Code analysis confirms sophisticated physics implementation:
- Dynamic gravity (2000 px/s²)
- Realistic ball restitution (0.55-0.65)
- Wind effects with proper scaling
- Collision detection with surface normals

**Phase 4 Score: 75/100** - Strong compliance with most requirements

## Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues Identified:

1. **Height Utilization Opportunity** (Low Priority)
   - Current: ~84% height utilization
   - Recommendation: Could optimize for ~90-95% while maintaining UI readability
   - Impact: Low - current implementation is acceptable

2. **Automated Testing Limitations** (Technical Debt)
   - Selenium interaction tests encountered coordinate boundary issues
   - Recommendation: Improve test coordinate calculations for canvas interactions
   - Impact: Testing efficiency only, not user-facing

### Recommendations for Final Polish:

#### High Priority:
1. **Performance Validation**: Real-device testing on older mobile devices
2. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Safari, Firefox compatibility verification
3. **Touch Target Testing**: Ensure mobile interaction zones are optimal

#### Medium Priority:
1. **Session Time Optimization**: Measure actual 30-second completion rates
2. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support consideration
3. **Visual Polish**: Minor UI refinements based on user feedback

#### Low Priority:
1. **Height Utilization**: Squeeze additional 5-10% screen usage if feasible
2. **Advanced Analytics**: User interaction heatmap implementation
