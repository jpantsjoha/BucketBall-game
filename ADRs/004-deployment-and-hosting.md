# ADR-004: Deployment Architecture and Hosting Strategy

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - August 25, 2025

## Context
BucketBall requires fast, reliable hosting with global reach to support the $1M+ market opportunity. The game must be instantly playable without installation barriers.

## Decision
Deploy as static web application with modern hosting infrastructure:

### Primary Hosting Recommendation: **Vercel**

#### Rationale
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: Static site deployment with git integration
- ✅ **Global CDN**: Automatic worldwide distribution
- ✅ **Edge Computing**: Sub-100ms response times globally
- ✅ **Free Tier**: Sufficient for initial launch and testing
- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS**: Built-in SSL certificates
- ✅ **Custom Domains**: Professional branding support
- ✅ **Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring

### Alternative Options Considered

#### Firebase Hosting
- **Pros**: Google infrastructure, good mobile optimization
- **Cons**: More complex setup, vendor lock-in concerns
- **Verdict**: Good backup option

#### GitHub Pages  
- **Pros**: Free, integrated with repository
- **Cons**: Limited performance, no edge computing
- **Verdict**: Development/demo only

#### Google Cloud Storage
- **Pros**: Scalable, enterprise-grade
- **Cons**: Requires more configuration, cost complexity
- **Verdict**: Overkill for static site

## Architecture Decisions

### Static Site Architecture
```
BucketBall-game/
├── index.html          # Single page application
├── game.js            # Core game logic
├── style.css          # Responsive styling  
├── assets/            # Game sprites and images
└── vercel.json        # Deployment configuration
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Asset Optimization**
   - PNG sprites with multiple DPI versions (@1x, @2x, @3x)
   - Compressed images for fast loading
   - Efficient asset loading with fallbacks

2. **Code Optimization**
   - Minification for production builds
   - Single file architecture (no bundling needed)
   - Efficient canvas rendering

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Static asset caching via CDN
   - Browser caching headers
   - Version-based cache busting

### Deployment Configuration
```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/**",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment
1. **Repository Setup**: Connect GitHub to Vercel
2. **Domain Configuration**: Custom domain with SSL
3. **Performance Testing**: Load time and responsiveness validation
4. **Analytics Setup**: User engagement tracking

### Phase 2: Production Optimization
1. **CDN Configuration**: Global edge distribution
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Uptime and performance alerts
3. **A/B Testing Infrastructure**: Feature flag support
4. **Backup Strategy**: Multi-region failover

### Phase 3: Scale Preparation  
1. **Load Testing**: High traffic simulation
2. **Performance Budgets**: Asset size and load time limits
3. **Global Optimization**: Region-specific improvements

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Instant Playability**: No app store barriers
- ✅ **Global Performance**: <2 second load times worldwide
- ✅ **Zero Maintenance**: Automatic scaling and updates
- ✅ **Cost Effective**: Free tier supports initial growth
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Simple deployment workflow

### Negative  
- ⚠️ **Browser Dependency**: Requires modern browser support
- ⚠️ **Offline Limitations**: No native offline capabilities
- ⚠️ **Platform Limitations**: No native mobile features initially

### Risk Mitigation
- Progressive Web App features for app-like experience
- Browser compatibility testing across target devices
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds on 3G networks
- **First Paint**: <1 second on desktop  
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Global Response**: <100ms from major cities

### Business Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: <30% (fast loading critical)
- **Session Duration**: 3-5 minutes average
- **Return Rate**: >40% daily returns
- **Share Rate**: >5% social sharing

## Future Considerations

### PWA Enhancement
- Service worker for offline play
- App installation prompts
- Push notification support

### Native App Strategy
- React Native wrapper for app stores
- Performance comparison with web version
- Feature parity maintenance

### Advanced Hosting
- Multi-region deployment
- Edge computing for multiplayer features
- Real-time leaderboards infrastructure
